You are part of a team developing an inventory management system for a retail company. The system needs to track product availability across multiple warehouses. Each warehouse is represented as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the product identifier and the quantity available. Your task is to implement a feature that checks if a given product is available in any of the warehouses and returns the total quantity available.
Design a Python program to implement the inventory management system. Create lists to represent three warehouses, each containing tuples of product identifiers and quantities available. Then, prompt the user to enter a product identifier and check if the product is available in any of the warehouses. If available, display the total quantity available across all warehouses; otherwise, display a message indicating that the product is out of stock.

warehouse1 = [("product1", 50), ("product2", 30), ("product3", 20)]
warehouse2 = [("product4", 40), ("product2", 20), ("product5", 60)]
warehouse3 = [("product6", 70), ("product3", 10), ("product7", 25)]

product_id = input("Enter product identifier: ")

total_quantity = 0
found = False

for warehouse in [warehouse1, warehouse2, warehouse3]:
    for item in warehouse:
        if item[0] == product_id:
            total_quantity += item[1]
            found = True
            break  

if found:
    print(f"Total quantity of product {product_id}: {total_quantity}")
else:
    print("Product is out of stock.")

Sample Output :
Total quantity of product product3: 30
